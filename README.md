Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Analysis
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of various unsupervised learning techniques for clustering analysis. It includes implementations of K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms to identify natural groupings or patterns within unlabeled data.
Features

Generation of synthetic dataset for clustering
Implementation of three clustering algorithms:

K-means
Hierarchical Clustering
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)


Evaluation of clustering results using:

Silhouette Score
Davies-Bouldin Index


Visualization of clustering results

Requirements

Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Output
The script will print the evaluation metrics (Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index) for each clustering method and display scatter plots visualizing the resulting clusters.
Customization
You can modify the following parameters in the main() function:

Number of samples, features, and clusters in the generate_data() function
Number of clusters for K-means and Hierarchical Clustering
Epsilon and minimum samples for DBSCAN
